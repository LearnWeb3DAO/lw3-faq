### Q1. Is it unsafe to connect my eth_address with the website?

No, connecting your address to the website doesn't give the website access to your private key, so it's completely safe. It is important to receive NFT's which will further give you access to the job board etc

### Q2. Why is my progress not syncing?

It takes sometime to sync the progress. If it doesnt sync for a long time, ask for help on discord.

### Q3. Why I am facing "Nothing to compile" issue while compiling my contract in Windows Device?

You need to check and Update your `Hardhat` Version to "2.9.6". You can do this by entering this command ` npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.9.6" `

### Q4. Do I have to get 100% to pass the skill test?

Yes, you would need to get a 100% but the good thing is you can give the test as many times as you want until you get a 100. The reason we think this is important is because we want you to understand the entire topic before you proceed to the next topic.

### Q5. My scores don't show up on the dashboard, what can I do?

If you're having trouble with quiz skill test scores showing up which you did in Google Forms, they can take a few minutes to sync. Also, ensure you used the same email to login to the website as you provided in the skill test.
