### Q1. Is it unsafe to connect my eth_address with the website?

No, connecting your address to the website doesn't give the website access to your private key, so it's completely safe. It is important to receive NFT's which will further give you access to the job board etc

### Q2. Why is my progress not syncing?

It takes sometime to sync the progress. If it doesnt sync for a long time, ask for help on discord. Be sure that you've completed all three steps at the top of the track's page: Link Discord, Join Discord, and Link ETH Wallet. If any of these steps are incomplete or show a red "X", your progress will not sync. The email you use in the Skill Test (Google Form) must also match the email address that is associated with your account.

### Q3. Why I am facing "Nothing to compile" issue while compiling my contract in Windows Device?

You need to check and Update your `Hardhat` Version to "2.9.6". You can do this by entering this command ` npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.9.6" `
