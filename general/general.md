### Q1. Is it unsafe to connect my eth_address with the website?

No, connecting your address to the website doesn't give the website access to your private key, so it's completely safe. It is important to receive NFT's which will further give you access to the job board etc

### Q2. Why is my progress not syncing?

It takes sometime to sync the progress. If it doesnt sync for a long time, ask for help on discord.

### Q3. Why I am facing "Nothing to compile" issue while compiling my contract in Windows Device?

You need to check and Update your `Hardhat` Version to "2.9.6". You can do this by entering this command ` npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.9.6" `

### Q4. How do I view my graduation NFTs in Metamask?

The graduation NFTs are minted on the Polygon Mainnet. In order to view them in your MetaMask wallet you first need to add the Polygon Mainnet network and then add the NFT assets.

Note: NFTs can only be displayed in the mobile version of MetaMask at the moment.

#### Add the Polygon Mainnet in Metamask

1. Open your MetaMask mobile app and click on the "Networks" dropdown at the top of the screen. Below the list of networks, click the "Add Network" button.

2. I the form on the next screen, fill in the Polygon Mainnet details:
        
    - Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
    - New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com
    - ChainID: 137
    - Symbol: MATIC
    - Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com/
    
    You may also use one of the following RPC URLs if you don't want to use the one above:

    - https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network
    - https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com
    - https://rpc-mainnet.matic.quiknode.pro

    Click save when you have filled in the form.

Once you are done, make sure that the Polygon Mainnet is selected in the "Networks" dropdown.

#### Add your NFT in MetaMask

1. Login to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) using the Ethereum Mainnet and go to your profile.

2. Find your NFT(s) and unhide it if it is hidden.

3. Go to the NFT's listing page and copy the contract address and token ID under the details section. Here it is if you're not sure where to get it:

    - Contract address: 0x1ed25648382c2e6da067313e5dacb4f138bc8b33
    - Token IDs:

        - Freshman: 0
        - Sophmore: 1
        - Junior: 2
        - Senior: 3

4. In your MetaMask wallet (when you are connected to the Polygon Mainnet), tap on the "NFTs" tab and tap on the "Import NFTs" link.

5. Fill in the address and token ID and click the "Import" button. Your NFT is now visible in your MetaMask wallet, the image will take some time to show up.
